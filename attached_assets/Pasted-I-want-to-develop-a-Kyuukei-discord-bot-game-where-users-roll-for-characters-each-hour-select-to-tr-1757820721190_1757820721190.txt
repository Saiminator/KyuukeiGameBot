I want to develop a Kyuukei discord bot game where users roll for characters each hour, select to train one of them in dms and go through a whole choose your adventure/training game until the character is "finished" and then their stats, abilities, items/equipment, and all relevent data is saved and stored to their user ID to be used in other events or pvp. here is the whole game plan, i want you to help me code the entire thing.

1) Vision & Pillars

Collect → Train → Lock → Battle. Players roll character seeds, train in DMs, then lock a finished profile for future PvP.

Lore-true but gamey. Systems feel like Kyuukei (unique powers, counters) while remaining simple, fair, and repeatable.

Data-driven content. New trainings, events, items, and quests are added as blocks with weights and simple conditions.

2) Core Stats (8)

Str, Agi, Sta, Mag, Wit, Wil, Cha, Luk
(strength, agility, stamina, magic, wits, will, charisma, luck)

Sta primarily drives survivability/HP.

Wit = precision/ability control.

Wil = mental resistance/resolve.

Luk = small swing factor across checks.

3) Hourly Rolls (Server or DM)

Cooldown: 1 roll batch per user per hour.

Batch Size: 5–10 candidates (configurable).

Per-Stat Roll: Each stat rolls a % in [70–115].

COTD bonus (rolling only): If the candidate’s character is Character of the Day, add +10 percentage points per stat before applying to base stats, capped at 115% per stat.

Final Tier (cosmetic): Compute the average of the 8 post-boost % values:

D: 70–79, C: 80–89, B: 90–99, A: 100–109, S: 110–115.

(A roll on COTD often crosses into S due to +10pp.)

Choose 1 candidate to start training; Trash All discards the batch.

4) Run & Training (DMs)

Run start: Choosing a candidate moves the session to DMs; all training occurs there.

Turn cadence: Each “day/turn” presents 3 options:

Regular Training (default): label + expected stat focus; no pre-choice flair.

Event (rarer): includes pre-choice flavor text in the menu and special outcomes (rewards/risks).

Event Frequency (recommended default):

70%: 0 events, 25%: 1 event, 5%: 2 events among the three options.

Pity: if a player has gone 5 days without an event, guarantee ≥1 event next day.

Selection rules: Owner-only clicks; options drawn by weighted sampling with guardrails (avoid repeating the same primary tag back-to-back if configured).

Outcomes: Apply stat gains (scaled by character growth weights), flags, items, coins, story progress, injuries/heal, or open shop.

Save point: Autosave after EVERY step (before and after effects).

Run length: Configurable (e.g., up to 14 days), or early completion via events/quests.

Finish: On completion, the run is locked into a permanent Card in the user’s collection.

Training COTD: By default, no extra training bonus—only rolling gets +10pp. (You can enable a small training boost later if desired.)

5) Content Blocks (Data-Driven)

All authored as blocks with:

ID, label, kind (training or event), weight, optional primary_tag for diversity.

Eligibility: requires / excludes conditions (flags, day, story stage, items, character, etc.).

Effects: stat ranges, coins, flags set/unset, story flag advances, injuries/heal, unlocks, open store, grant item.

Flair:

Event blocks show pre-choice flair in the menu.

Both can show post-result flair after selection.

Quests are multi-stage event chains keyed by story flags (each stage is just another block).

6) Shops & Items

Shop access: Per-character toggle (e.g., some can’t shop; others can).

Shops: Label + inventory (price, stock per run/global, requirements, who can see/buy).

Items: Name, description, tags, restrictions (which characters can use), PvP effects (e.g., bonus to seal checks, anti-regen finisher), and whether obtainable via shop or only via quest/event.

Currency: Coins (simple, optional). Earned via trainings/events; spent in shops.

7) Locking & Collection

Lock occurs automatically at run end (or manually if allowed).

Card stores: final stats, items, flags/unlocks relevant for PvP, season ID, cosmetic tier (from average %), and provenance (COTD used, etc.).

Collection: Players can view their locked cards and select one for PvP.

8) PvP (Auto-Resolved, One Pass)

Selection: /pvp @opponent my:<card_id> vs:<their_card_id>

Working snapshot: Copy card stats; apply item/unlock modifiers and any season rules. (COTD does not alter PvP unless you later add a small perk.)

Resolution model: Short, deterministic sequence of contested checks using a simple rule:

Opposed chance: A vs B → A / (A + B) (clean, intuitively fair).

Sequence structure (recommended):

Initiative: Agi vs Agi → acting order (minor flinch chance on large margin).

Ability pass: Evaluate each character’s unique power once (or as specified).

Damage exchange: 1–2 quick exchanges (Str/Mag vs Agi/Sta) with caps to prevent one-shots.

Win checks: KO, Transform/Capture/Seal, Charm Lock, or Draw.

Narration: The engine outputs immutable battle facts (winner, key passes/fails, % rolls, items used). Feed those to an AI only for flavor text; it cannot alter the outcome.

Signature Ability Templates (lore-true, simple gates)

Shimi — Transform (instant-win path, multi-gate):
Approach (Agi+Wit) → Grapple (Str+Agi) → Overwrite (Wit+Mag) → Anti-flinch (foe Agi vs Shimi Agi) → Will (Wil+Wit).
Success at the final Will gate = win; failures continue the fight. Items like Sealing Threads add resist pp to Will or boost anti-transform defenses.

Kyuu — Regen + Seal-Gated Defeat:
Regenerates each sequence. To truly defeat Kyuu, opponents must succeed at Seal (Wit+Mag vs Wit+Wil) or Contain (Str+Wit vs Str+Agi) or use an Anti-Regen Finisher. Otherwise, KO can stall to Draw.

Dreymi — Charm/Drain Snowball:
Charm (Cha vs Wil) applies debuffs; Drain heals on hit. If debuff stacks peak and she wins a Wit vs Wil lock check, she Dominates (win).

(Add others similarly: Pon = copy a buff/ability window; Sera = occasional double-action via Agi+Wit; Memo = mana drain scaling off Wit.)

9) Balance & Tuning Knobs

Roll bands (70–115), COTD +10pp, stat cap (e.g., 999).

Event mix (0/1/2) + pity window.

Training growth weights per character (how efficiently a stat grows).

Ability gate weights (e.g., Transform Will gate threshold).

Damage caps (per exchange cap) and sequence length (to avoid marathons).

Item effects (e.g., +seal %, +Will pp, anti-regen flag).

Season rules file: all numeric dials adjustable without code.

10) UX & Rules

Owner-only interactions: Buttons/selects/reactions accept input only from the run/card owner.

Crash-safe: Autosave after every action. On restart, automatically DM Resume for any run waiting on a choice.

DM-first training: Rolls can happen in server or DM; training always continues in DMs. If DMs are closed, prompt in server to open them; progress is never lost.

Transparency: Roll displays show per-stat % after COTD (cap noted) and overall Avg % (Tier).

11) Player Lifecycle

Roll (hourly): preview 5–10 candidates with per-stat %s (COTD included, capped).

Choose 1 or Trash All.

Train in DMs: 3 options/turn (mostly regular; events some days), autosave each pick.

Finish: character locks as a Card in collection (cosmetic tier saved).

PvP anytime with locked cards (auto sim + narrated flair).

Repeat each hour for new seeds; collect a roster.

12) Content Authoring Guidelines

Keep regular trainings short, focused (2 stats max per option).

Use primary_tag for variety control (speed, control, rest, risk, shop, etc.).

Events should feel meaningful—bigger swings, unique flavor, sometimes risk (injury, notoriety) with proportionate rewards (items, unlocks).

Items should unlock counters to strong abilities (seal, anti-regen, mirror/reflect, stun) and subtle edges (+pp to Will checks).

Quests deliver identity: a 2–4 stage arc per character per season, ending with a unlock/item that matters in PvP.

13) Economy (Optional, Simple)

Coins earned from trainings/events; spent in shops.

Per-run stock for rare items to gate power (e.g., 1 Mirror Cloak per run).

Keep economy light—main loop is progression, not grinding.

14) Seasons

All live content sits under a Season (e.g., 2025S1): config, character bases, training/events, shops/items, PvP balance.

New season = duplicate folder + tweak numbers/content. Old cards retain their season tag (for ladders or nostalgia modes later).

15) Anti-Abuse & Fairness

Enforce hourly cooldown strictly per user.

Owner-only inputs (reject/ignore others).

Batch expiry (e.g., unchosen roll sets expire after ~30–60 minutes).

Seeded randomness per user/day/match for reproducibility and auditability.

Draws exist (esp. vs Kyuu without proper counters) to prevent forced wins.

16) MVP Scope (what to build first)

Rolling with per-stat % and COTD +10pp cap 115, tier by average (cosmetic).

DM training with 3 options (regular + event mix), pity logic, shops/items.

Autosave & resume; owner-only interactions.

Locking to card; collection view.

PvP auto-sim with the three marquee abilities (Shimi, Kyuu, Dreymi) and concise narrated flair.
